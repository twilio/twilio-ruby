For more information, see the
`Recordings REST Resource <http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/recording>`_
documentation.


Audio Formats
-----------------

Each :class:`Recording` has a few special methods. To get the url
for the wav format of this recording, use :meth:`Recording.wav`. For the
mp3 format, use :meth:`Recording.mp3`. To make requests for either of 
these formats use the same method with a '!' appended. These methods
both take a block to be executed as soon as the response returns.


Listing Your Recordings
----------------------------

The following code will print out the :attr:`duration`
for each :class:`Recording`.

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'twilio-ruby'

    # To find these visit https://www.twilio.com/user/account
    account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    auth_token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"

    @client = Twilio::REST::Client.new account_sid, auth_token

    @client.account.recordings.list().each do |recording|
        puts recording.duration

You can filter recordings by CallSid by passing the Sid as :attr:`call`.
Filter recordings using :attr:`before` and :attr:`after` dates.

The following will only show recordings made before January 1, 2011.

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'twilio-ruby'

    # To find these visit https://www.twilio.com/user/account
    account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    auth_token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"

    @client = Twilio::REST::Client.new account_sid, auth_token
    @client.account.recordings.list(before=date(2011,1,1)).each do |recording|:
        puts recording.duration


Deleting Recordings
---------------------

The :class:`Recordings` resource allows you to delete unnecessary recordings.

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'twilio-ruby'

    # To find these visit https://www.twilio.com/user/account
    account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    auth_token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"

    @client = Twilio::REST::Client.new account_sid, auth_token
    @client.account.recordings.get("RC123").delete()


Accessing Related Transcptions
-------------------------------

The :class:`Recordings` allows you to retrieve associated transcriptions.
The following prints out the text for each of the transcriptions associated
with this recording.

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'twilio-ruby'

    # To find these visit https://www.twilio.com/user/account
    account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    auth_token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"

    @client = Twilio::REST::Client.new account_sid, auth_token
    @recording = @client.account.recordings.get("RC123")

    @recording.transcriptions.list().each do |transcription|
        puts transcription.transcription_text
