    ##
    # The Twilio::REST::Client class caches authentication parameters and
    # exposes methods to make HTTP requests to Twilio's REST API. However, you
    # should never really need to call these methods yourself since you can
    # work with the more pleasant wrapper objects like Twilio::REST::Call.
    #
    # Instantiate a client like so:
    #
    #   @client = Twilio::REST::Client.new account_sid, auth_token
    #
    # There are a few options you can use to configure the way your client will
    # communicate with Twilio. See #new for a list and descriptions.
    #
    # Once you have a client object you can use it to do fun things. Every
    # client object exposes two wrapper objects which you can use as entry
    # points into Twilio: +account+ and +accounts+.
    #
    # ==== @client.account
    #
    # Most of the time you'll want to start with the +account+ attribute. This
    # object is an instance of Twilio::REST::Account that wraps the account
    # referenced by the +account_sid+ you used when instantiating the client.
    #
    # An instance of Twilio::REST::Account exposes objects wrapping all of the
    # account-level Twilio resources as properties. So
    #
    #   @client.account.calls
    #
    # For convenience, the resources of the default account are also available
    # on the client object. So the following call is equivalent to the example
    # above
    #
    #   @client.calls
    #
    # represents an account's call list.
    #
    # ==== @client.accounts
    #
    # If you are doing anything related to subaccounts you'll want to start
    # here. This object is an instance of Twilio::REST::Accounts that wraps
    # the list of accounts belonging to the master account referenced by
    # the +account_sid+ used to instantiate the client.
    #
    # This class inherits from Twilio::REST::ListResource, so you can use
    # methods like ListResource#list to return a (possibly filtered) list of
    # accounts and ListResource#create to create a new account. Use
    # ListResource#get to grab a particular account once you know its sid.

      # The port on which to connect to the above domain. Defaults to 443 and

      #
      # Declare whether ssl should be used for connections to the above domain.
      # Defaults to true and should be left alone except when testing.

      # === <tt>ssl_verify_peer: true</tt>
      #
      # Declare whether to verify the host's ssl cert when setting up the
      # connection to the above domain. Defaults to true, but can be turned off
      # to avoid ssl certificate verification failures in environments without
      # the necessary ca certificates.
      #
      # === <tt>ssl_ca_file: '/path/to/ca/file'</tt>
      #
      # Specify the path to the certificate authority bundle you'd like to use
      # to verify Twilio's SSL certificate on each request. If not specified, a
      # certificate bundle extraced from Firefox is packaged with the gem and
      # used by default.

      # === <tt>timeout: 30</tt>
      #
      # Set the time in seconds to wait before timing out the HTTP request.
      # Defaults to 30 seconds. If you aren't fetching giant pages of call or
      # SMS logs you can safely decrease this to something like 3 seconds or
      # lower. In paricular if you are sending SMS you can set this to 1 second
      # or less and swallow the exception if you don't care about the response.
      #

      # The domain of a proxy through which you'd like the client to make HTTP
      # requests. Defaults to nil.

      #
      # The port on which to connect to the above proxy. Defaults to nil.
