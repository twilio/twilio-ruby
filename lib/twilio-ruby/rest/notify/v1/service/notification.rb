            # Retrieve a single page of NotificationInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] body The notification text. For FCM and GCM, translates to
            #   `data.twi_body`. For APNS, translates to `aps.alert.body`. For SMS, translates
            #   to `body`. SMS requires either this `body` value, or `media_urls` attribute
            #   defined in the `sms` parameter of the notification.
            # @param [notification.Priority] priority The priority of the notification. Can
            #   be: `low` or `high` and the default is `high`. A value of `low` optimizes the
            #   client app's battery consumption; however, notifications may be delivered with
            #   unspecified delay. For FCM and GCM, `low` priority is the same as `Normal`
            #   priority. For APNS `low` priority is the same as `5`. A value of `high` sends
            #   the notification immediately, and can wake up a sleeping device. For FCM and
            #   GCM, `high` is the same as `High` priority. For APNS, `high` is a priority `10`.
            #   SMS does not support this property.
            # @param [String] ttl How long, in seconds, the notification is valid. Can be an
            #   integer between 0 and 2,419,200, which is 4 weeks, the default and the maximum
            #   supported time to live (TTL). Delivery should be attempted if the device is
            #   offline until the TTL elapses. Zero means that the notification delivery is
            #   attempted immediately, only once, and is not stored for future delivery. SMS
            #   does not support this property.
            # @param [String] title The notification title. For FCM and GCM, this translates
            #   to the `data.twi_title` value. For APNS, this translates to the
            #   `aps.alert.title` value. SMS does not support this property. This field is not
            #   visible on iOS phones and tablets but appears on Apple Watch and Android
            #   devices.
            # @param [String] sound The name of the sound to be played for the notification.
            #   For FCM and GCM, this Translates to `data.twi_sound`.  For APNS, this translates
            #   to `aps.sound`.  SMS does not support this property.
            # @param [String] action The actions to display for the notification. For APNS,
            #   translates to the `aps.category` value. For GCM, translates to the
            #   `data.twi_action` value. For SMS, this parameter is not supported and is omitted
            #   from deliveries to those channels.
            # @param [Hash] data The custom key-value pairs of the notification's payload. For
            #   FCM and GCM, this value translates to `data` in the FCM and GCM payloads. FCM
            #   and GCM [reserve certain
            #   keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref) that
            #   cannot be used in those channels. For APNS, attributes of `data` are inserted
            #   into the APNS payload as custom properties outside of the `aps` dictionary. In
            #   all channels, we reserve keys that start with `twi_` for future use. Custom keys
            #   that start with `twi_` are not allowed and are rejected as 400 Bad request with
            #   no delivery attempted. For SMS, this parameter is not supported and is omitted
            #   from deliveries to those channels.
            # @param [Hash] apn The APNS-specific payload that overrides corresponding
            #   attributes in the generic payload for APNS Bindings. This property maps to the
            #   APNS `Payload` item, therefore the `aps` key must be used to change standard
            #   attributes. Adds custom key-value pairs to the root of the dictionary. See the
            #   [APNS
            #   documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html) for more details. We reserve keys that start with `twi_` for future use. Custom keys that start with `twi_` are not allowed.
            # @param [Hash] gcm The GCM-specific payload that overrides corresponding
            #   attributes in the generic payload for GCM Bindings.  This property maps to the
            #   root JSON dictionary. See the [GCM
            #   documentation](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref)
            #   for more details. Target parameters `to`, `registration_ids`, and
            #   `notification_key` are not allowed. We reserve keys that start with `twi_` for
            #   future use. Custom keys that start with `twi_` are not allowed. GCM also
            #   [reserves certain
            #   keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref).
            # @param [Hash] sms The SMS-specific payload that overrides corresponding
            #   attributes in the generic payload for SMS Bindings.  Each attribute in this
            #   value maps to the corresponding `form` parameter of the Twilio
            #   [Message](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/send-messages) resource.  These
            #   parameters of the Message resource are supported in snake case format: `body`,
            #   `media_urls`, `status_callback`, and `max_price`.  The `status_callback`
            #   parameter overrides the corresponding parameter in the messaging service, if
            #   configured. The `media_urls` property expects a JSON array.
            # @param [Hash] facebook_messenger Deprecated.
            # @param [Hash] fcm The FCM-specific payload that overrides corresponding
            #   attributes in the generic payload for FCM Bindings. This property maps to the
            #   root JSON dictionary. See the [FCM
            #   documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#downstream) for more details. Target parameters `to`, `registration_ids`, `condition`, and `notification_key` are not allowed in this parameter. We reserve keys that start with `twi_` for future use. Custom keys that start with `twi_` are not allowed. FCM also [reserves certain keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref), which cannot be used in that channel.
            # @param [String] segment The Segment resource is deprecated. Use the `tag`
            #   parameter, instead.
            # @param [Hash] alexa Deprecated.
            # @param [String] to_binding The destination address specified as a JSON string.
            #   Multiple `to_binding` parameters can be included but the total size of the
            #   request entity should not exceed 1MB. This is typically sufficient for 10,000
            #   phone numbers.
            # @param [String] identity The `identity` value that uniquely identifies the new
            #   resource's [User](https://www.twilio.com/docs/chat/rest/users) within the
            #   [Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/notify/api/service-resource). Delivery
            #   will be attempted only to Bindings with an Identity in this list. No more than
            #   20 items are allowed in this list.
            # @param [String] tag A tag that selects the Bindings to notify. Repeat this
            #   parameter to specify more than one tag, up to a total of 5 tags. The implicit
            #   tag `all` is available to notify all Bindings in a Service instance. Similarly,
            #   the implicit tags `apn`, `fcm`, `gcm`, `sms` and `facebook-messenger` are
            #   available to notify all Bindings in a specific channel.
