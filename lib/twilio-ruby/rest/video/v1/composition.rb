          # @param [String] resolution A string that describes the columns (width) and rows
          #   (height) of the generated composed video in pixels. Defaults to `640x480`.

          #   media files. Can be: `mp4` or `webm` and the default is `webm`. If you specify
          #   `mp4` or `webm`, you must also specify one or more `audio_sources` and/or a
          #   `video_layout` element that contains a valid `video_sources` list, otherwise an
          #   error occurs.
          # @param [String] status_callback The URL we should call using the
          #   `status_callback_method` to send status information to your application on every
          #   composition event. If not provided, status callback events will not be
