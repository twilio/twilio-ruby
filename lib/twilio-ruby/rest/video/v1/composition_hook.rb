          # @param [Hash] video_layout A JSON object defining the video layout of the
          #   Composition Hook in terms of regions. See the section [Specifying Video
          #   Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for further information.
          # @param [String] audio_sources An array of audio sources to merge. All the
          #   specified sources must belong to the same Group Room. It can include zero or
          #   more Track names. These can be specified using wildcards (e.g. `student*`). The
          #   use of `[*]` has semantics "all if any" meaning zero or more (i.e. all)
          #   depending on whether the Group Room had audio tracks.
          # @param [String] audio_sources_excluded An array of audio sources to exclude from
          #   the Composition Hook. Any new Composition triggered by the Composition Hook
          #   shall include all audio sources specified in `AudioSources` except for the ones
          #   specified in `AudioSourcesExcluded`. This parameter may include zero or more
          #   Track names. These can be specified using wildcards (e.g. `student*`).
          # @param [String] resolution A string representing the number of pixels for rows
          #   (width) and columns (height) of the generated composed video. This string must
          #   have the format `{width}x{height}`. This parameter must comply with the
          #   following constraints:
          #
          #   * `width >= 16 && width <= 1280`
          #   * `height >= 16 && height <= 1280`
          #   * `width * height <= 921,600`
          #
          #   Typical values are:
          #
          #   * HD = `1280x720`
          #   * PAL = `1024x576`
          #   * VGA = `640x480`
          #   * CIF = `320x240`
          #
          #   Note that the `Resolution` implicitly imposes an aspect ratio to the resulting
          #   composition. When the original video tracks get constrained by this aspect ratio
          #   they are scaled-down to fit. You can find detailed information in the
          #   [Specifying Video
          #   Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) section. Defaults to `640x480`.
          # @param [composition_hook.Format] format Container format of the Composition
          #   media files created by the Composition Hook. Can be any of the following: `mp4`,
          #   `webm`. The use of `mp4` or `webm` makes mandatory the specification of
          #   `AudioSources` and/or one `VideoLayout` element containing a valid
          #   `video_sources` list, otherwise an error is fired. Defaults to `webm`.
          # @param [String] status_callback A URL that Twilio sends asynchronous webhook
          #   requests to on every composition event. If not provided, status callback events
          #   will not be dispatched.
          # @param [String] status_callback_method HTTP method Twilio should use when

          #   active media in the Compositions triggered by the Composition Hook. This results

          #   media files created by the Composition Hook. Can be any of the following: `mp4`,
