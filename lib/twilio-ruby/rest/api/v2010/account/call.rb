            # Retrieve a single page of CallInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] to The phone number, SIP address, or client identifier to call.
            # @param [String] from The phone number or client identifier to use as the caller
            #   id. If using a phone number, it must be a Twilio number or a Verified [outgoing
            #   caller id](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/outgoing-caller-ids) for your
            #   account. If the `to` parameter is a phone number, `From` must also be a phone
            #   number.
            # @param [String] method The HTTP method we should use when calling the `url`
            #   parameter's value. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and the default is `POST`. If an
            #   `application_sid` parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
            # @param [String] fallback_url The URL that we call using the `fallback_method` if
            #   an error occurs when requesting or executing the TwiML at `url`. If an
            #   `application_sid` parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
            # @param [String] fallback_method The HTTP method that we should use to request
            #   the `fallback_url`. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and the default is `POST`. If an
            #   `application_sid` parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
            # @param [String] status_callback The URL we should call using the
            #   `status_callback_method` to send status information to your application. If no
            #   `status_callback_event` is specified, we will send the `completed` status. If an
            #   `application_sid` parameter is present, this parameter is ignored. URLs must
            #   contain a valid hostname (underscores are not permitted).
            # @param [String] status_callback_event The call progress events that we will send
            #   to the `status_callback` URL. Can be: `initiated`, `ringing`, `answered`, and
            #   `completed`. If no event is specified, we send the `completed` status. If you
            #   want to receive multiple events, specify each one in a separate
            #   `status_callback_event` parameter. See the code sample for [monitoring call
            #   progress](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/call?code-sample=code-create-a-call-and-specify-a-statuscallbackevent). If an `application_sid` is present, this parameter is ignored.
            # @param [String] status_callback_method The HTTP method we should use when
            #   calling the `status_callback` URL. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and the default is
            #   `POST`. If an `application_sid` parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
            # @param [String] send_digits A string of keys to dial after connecting to the
            #   number, maximum of 32 digits. Valid digits in the string include: any digit
            #   (`0`-`9`), '`#`', '`*`' and '`w`', to insert a half second pause. For example,
            #   if you connected to a company phone number and wanted to pause for one second,
            #   and then dial extension 1234 followed by the pound key, the value of this
            #   parameter would be `ww1234#`. Remember to URL-encode this string, since the
            #   '`#`' character has special meaning in a URL. If both `SendDigits` and
            #   `MachineDetection` parameters are provided, then `MachineDetection` will be
            #   ignored.
            # @param [String] timeout The integer number of seconds that we should allow the
            #   phone to ring before assuming there is no answer. The default is `60` seconds
            #   and the maximum is `600` seconds. For some call flows, we will add a 5-second
            #   buffer to the timeout value you provide. For this reason, a timeout value of 10
            #   seconds could result in an actual timeout closer to 15 seconds. You can set this
            #   to a short time, such as `15` seconds, to hang up before reaching an answering
            #   machine or voicemail.
            # @param [Boolean] record Set this parameter to `true` to record the phone call.
            #   The `recording_url` will be sent to the `status_callback` URL. The default is
            #   `false`.
            # @param [String] recording_channels The number of channels in the final
            #   recording. Can be: `mono` or `dual`. The default is `mono`. `mono` records both
            #   legs of the call in a single channel of the recording file. `dual` records each
            #   leg to a separate channel of the recording file. The first channel of a
            #   dual-channel recording contains the parent call and the second channel contains
            #   the child call.
            # @param [String] recording_status_callback The URL that we call when the
            #   recording is available to be accessed.
            # @param [String] recording_status_callback_method The HTTP method we should use
            #   when calling the `recording_status_callback` URL. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and
            #   the default is `POST`.
            # @param [String] sip_auth_username The username used to authenticate the caller
            #   making a SIP call.
            # @param [String] sip_auth_password The password required to authenticate the user
            #   account specified in `sip_auth_username`.
            # @param [String] machine_detection Detect if a human, answering machine, or fax
            #   has picked up the call. Can be: `Enable` or `DetectMessageEnd`. Use `Enable` if
            #   you would like us to return `AnsweredBy` as soon as the called party is
            #   identified. Use `DetectMessageEnd`, if you would like to leave a message on an
            #   answering machine. If `send_digits` is provided, this parameter is ignored. For
            #   more information, see [Answering Machine
            #   Detection](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/answering-machine-detection).
            # @param [String] machine_detection_timeout The number of seconds that we should
            #   attempt to detect an answering machine before timing out and sending a voice
            #   request with `AnsweredBy` of `unknown`. The default timeout is 30 seconds.
            # @param [String] recording_status_callback_event The recording status events that
            #   will trigger calls to the URL specified in `recording_status_callback`. Can be:
            #   `in-progress`, `completed` and `absent`. Defaults to `completed`. Separate
            #   multiple values with a space.
            # @param [String] trim Whether to trim any leading and trailing silence from the
            #   recording. Can be: `trim-silence` or `do-not-trim` and the default is
            #   `trim-silence`.
            # @param [String] caller_id The phone number, SIP address, or Client identifier
            #   that made this call. Phone numbers are in [E.164
            #   format](https://wwnw.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) (e.g., +16175551212).
            #   SIP addresses are formatted as `name@company.com`.
            # @param [String] machine_detection_speech_threshold The number of milliseconds
            #   that is used as the measuring stick for the length of the speech activity, where
            #   durations lower than this value will be interpreted as a human and longer than
            #   this value as a machine. Possible Values: 1000-6000. Default: 2400.
            # @param [String] machine_detection_speech_end_threshold The number of
            #   milliseconds of silence after speech activity at which point the speech activity
            #   is considered complete. Possible Values: 500-5000. Default: 1200.
            # @param [String] machine_detection_silence_timeout The number of milliseconds of
            #   initial silence after which an `unknown` AnsweredBy result will be returned.
            #   Possible Values: 2000-10000. Default: 5000.
            # @param [String] url The absolute URL that returns the TwiML instructions for the
            #   call. We will call this URL using the `method` when the call connects. For more
            #   information, see the [Url
            #   Parameter](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls#specify-a-url-parameter)
            #   section in [Making Calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls).
            # @param [String] application_sid The SID of the Application resource that will
            #   handle the call, if the call will be handled by an application.
            # @return [CallInstance] Newly created CallInstance
